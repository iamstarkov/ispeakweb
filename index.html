<blockquote>
<p>Collective twitter account for frontend developers with a new author
every week</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s an interesting Reddit AMA analog, but in twitter and obviously with
new functions. It’s an ability to read and discuss significant
or controversial issues with weekly changing authors.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-should-i-care-why-should-i-follow-you" class="anchor" href="#why-should-i-care-why-should-i-follow-you" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why should I care? Why should I follow you?</h2>

<p>— You shouldn’t. Otherwise, you will get a huge amount of pros:</p>

<ul>
<li>Critical thinking: every author is unique, that’s why the views you
will find can be quintessentially different</li>
<li>Comfort zone: ispeakweb will make you step out of your comfort zone
in some cases</li>
<li>New: you will discover new trends, things and people</li>
<li>"Shuffle mode": it’s like a random song on the radio, you can definitely
find something, which you most likely would never have found</li>
<li>Experience: authors can share their experience gained over the years</li>
<li>Mind shift: authors can show professional insights and new approaches
that dramatically differ from yours</li>
<li>You can easily contact the author, ’cause it is two way communication channel</li>
<li>It’s fun</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ispeakweb">@ispeakweb</a> on twitter.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works?</h2>

<p>— New interesting authors weekly, you read and interact with them.</p>

<p>I promise, that I will choose new authors carefully, but nobody can say for sure
how it will be going in real life with every author. Things do happen, you know.</p>

<h2>
<a id="show-me-more" class="anchor" href="#show-me-more" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Show me more!</h2>

<p>— <em>ispeakweb</em> will have a statistics page and summary pages for each author.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-will-i-get-as-an-author" class="anchor" href="#what-will-i-get-as-an-author" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What will I get as an author?</h2>

<ul>
<li>New followers from your target audience</li>
<li>Test your ideas: get response from numerous followers</li>
<li>Test your experience, get advice from somebody more experienced than you</li>
<li>New people and catchy ideas</li>
<li>Exciting and completely new experience</li>
<li>Fewer restrictions as it’s not your private twitter!</li>
<li>Receive technical and common questions which you would never receive
in your private twitter.</li>
<li>It's just an honor</li>
<li>And fun</li>
</ul>

<a id="what-should-i-know-before-starting-my-week" class="anchor" href="#what-should-i-know-before-starting-my-week" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What should I know before starting my week?</h3>

<h4>
<a id="are-there-any-general-recommendations" class="anchor" href="#are-there-any-general-recommendations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are there any general recommendations?</h4>

<p>— Yeah, here they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>To begin with, update the bio, avatar, location and background image. Make
sure that description contains link to your own account</li>
<li>Say hello and introduce yourself briefly in a couple of tweets
at the beginning</li>
<li>Specify your plans for the week in one tweet</li>
<li>If it’s possible, make all mentioned above in five minutes to be sure that
your "intro" tweets will be grouped in timeline</li>
<li>If you want to answer, retweet the question first. Then write answers
as ordinary tweets. If you want, you can include question’s author
at the end of you answers</li>
<li>Say goodbye and show your appreciation to followers at the end</li>
</ol>

<a id="should-i-have-a-plan-for-my-week" class="anchor" href="#should-i-have-a-plan-for-my-week" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Should I have a plan for my week?</h4>

<p>— Tl;DR: You should. Experience leads us to conclude that having a plan is better
than not having it. Basically, you don’t need a plan itself — you need
a list of topics you want to discuss. Planning have great positive impact
on followers and authors itself.</p>

<a id="will-i-be-annoyed-by-replying-isnt-it-waste-of-time" class="anchor" href="#will-i-be-annoyed-by-replying-isnt-it-waste-of-time" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Will I be annoyed by replying? Isn’t it waste of time?</h4>

<p>— In some cases, but communication is the most important and interesting part
of @ispeakweb’s idea. Also, replying is easier than writing original tweets.
And you don’t need to feed the trolls.</p>

<a id="are-there-any-popular-topics-i-can-discuss-with-my-followers" class="anchor" href="#are-there-any-popular-topics-i-can-discuss-with-my-followers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Are there any popular topics I can discuss with my followers?</h4>

<p>— You probably can discuss something from the list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ways to rate other developers (github, stackoverflow etc.)</li>
<li>Rating and reviewing sites</li>
<li>Making interviews</li>
<li>Your attitude to opensource</li>
<li>Developers, you are inspired of or valuable for you (co-workers,
great mentors or bloggers)</li>
<li>Your projects</li>
<li>Forecast frontend trends in 5 years.</li>
<li>Your workplace and/or health-related topics</li>
<li>Your work setup: equipment, programs, .dotfiles and other</li>
<li>Your most interesting technical challenges</li>
<li>Your start in Computer Science</li>
<li>Your career path and current position</li>
<li>Your professional and common plans for future</li>
<li>Favorite core value and the way you live it</li>
<li>Your favorite professional experience</li>
<li>Work-life balance</li>
<li>Higher education, self-education and online education</li>
<li>Your contribution and responsibility as a web developer in the overall
picture of the world</li>
</ul>
