> Collective twitter account for frontend developers with a new author
every week

It’s an interesting Reddit AMA analog, but in twitter and obviously with
new functions. It’s an ability to read and discuss significant
or controversial issues with weekly changing authors.

## Why should I care? Why should I follow you?

— You shouldn’t. Otherwise, you will get a huge amount of pros:

* critical thinking: every author is unique, that’s why the views you
  will find can be quintessentially different
* comfort zone: ispeakweb will make you step out of your comfort zone
  in some cases
* new: you will discover new trends, things and people
* "shuffle mode": it’s like a random song on the radio, you can definitely
  find something, which you most likely would never have found
* experience: authors can share their experience gained over the years
* mind shift: authors can show professional insights and new approaches
  that dramatically differ from yours
* it's a platform for two way communication where you can easily contact
  the author
* it’s fun

Feel free to follow [@ispeakweb][isw] on twitter.

## How it works?

— I carefully pick up new authors weekly, you read and interact with them. Done.

PS. I’m starting the project in several weeks.

## My responsibilities as a host

I promise, that I will choose new authors carefully, but nobody can say for sure
how it will be going in real life with every author. Shit happens, you know.

## Show me more!

— _ispeakweb_ will have statistics page and summary pages per each author.

## Why should I become an author?

* pr: you will get more followers from your target audience
* you can test your ideas
* you can test your experience, maybe somebody is more experienced then
  you in some path.
* it’s similar to a talk on a conference. But with significant differences:
  more broaden audience and it lasts the whole week!
* you will meet new active and interesting people
* it’s significant experience
* it’s not your private twitter! you are having fewer restrictions
* people may feel embarrassed to ask you technical and common questions
  in your private twitter, but here is a proper place for such things
* it's just an honor
* it’s fun at least

###  What should I know before starting my week?

#### Are there any general recommendations?

— Yeah, we have them:

0. Please be polite
1. At the start, update description, avatar, location and background-image.
  Verify, that description contain link to your own account
2. Say hello and introduce yourself briefly in a couple of tweets at the
  beginning
3. Tell followers in a tweet about your plans for the week
4. If it possible, please do it in a five minutes, to be sure that your "intro"
  tweets will be grouped in timeline
5. If you want to answer, retweet the question first
6. Then write answers as ordinary tweets. If you want, you can include question’s
  author at the end of you answers
7. Say goodbye and show your appreciation to followers, at the end

#### Should I have a plan for week?

— Tl;DR: Yes. Experience leads us to conclude that to have a plan is better
than not to have. Basically, you don’t need a plan itself — you need
a list of topics you want to discuss. Planning have great positive impact
on followers and authors itself.

#### Will I be annoyed by replying? Will it waste my time?

— Probably, but communication is the most important and interesting part
of @ispeakweb’s idea. Also replying is easier, then writing original tweets.
And you don’t need to feed the trolls.

#### Are there any popular topics I can discuss with my followers?

— You probably can talk about something from this list:

* how would you rate other developers? _github, stackoverflow_
* how would you rate or review sites?
* how do you make interviews?
* what do you think about opensource?
* list developers, you are inspired of.
* list developers, valuable for you (co-workers, great mentors or bloggers)
* tell us about your projects
* try to predict future of frontend in 5 years.
* tell us your workplace and/or health-related topics
* tell us about your work setup: equipment, programs, .dotfiles and other
* what’s the most interesting technical challenge you’ve worked?
* how did you get started in Computer Science?
* what was your path to your current position in your carreer?
* what do you want to work on next?
* what is your favorite core value, and how do you live it?
* what’s your favorite experience?
* what is legacy know and what is good enough to be in future?
* how do you see you own purpose as a front-end developer in the overall
  picture of the world?
* what do you think about work-life balance?
* what do you think higher education, self-education and online education?

#### How make a proposal?
