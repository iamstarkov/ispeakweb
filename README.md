> Entirely new way to discover things and connect to people

Basically [_ispeakweb_][isw] is an collective twitter account with new author
every week.


## Why should I care?

— You will meet new developer every week, will get new thoughts and broaden your
horizons. If current author will want to share valuable people from his
environment, then you will also get in touch with them too. As far as every
author is unique, you will develop critical thinking, because new author can
be contradistinguish to previuos ones in any ways. You also get out of your
comfort zone on occasion.


## Ok, I’m sold. What should I do?

— Feel free to follow [@ispeakweb][isw].


## Stop. How it will work?

— I will pick up new authors weekly, you will read their tweets and interact
with them. Done.


## Show me more!

— You will have access to statistics page and to summary pages per each week.
Since we have not start now, we have no these pages, but I will create
and maintain them for you.
