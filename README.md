> Collective twitter account for frontend developers with new author every
week

It’s an interesting Reddit AMA analog, but in twitter and obviously with
changes. It’s an ability to read and discuss something valuable or meaningful
for weekly changing authors.


## Why should I care? Why should I follow you?

— You shouldn’t. Otherwise, you will have huge amount of pros:

* critical thinking: every author is unique, that’s why authors’ views
  can be contradistinguish to each other
* comfort zone: ispeakweb will get you out from your comfort zone on occasion
* new: you will discover new trends, things and people
* "shuffle mode": it’s like random song on the radio, you will read something,
  which potentially you will never read.
* experience: sometimes authors will share their experience earned over
  the years
* point of view switching: author will tell you something about work,
  experience and profession itself, from his point of view.
* it’s fun

Feel free to follow [@ispeakweb][isw] on twitter.



## Stop. How it works?

— I’m carefully picking up new authors weekly, you’re reading and interacting
with them. Done.

PS. Currently it’s not working, because we have not started yet.


## Show me more!

— _ispeakweb_ will have statistics page and summary pages per each author


## Why should I become an author?

* pr: you will get more followers from your target audience
* you will can attempt to put your inner world and personal views questioned
* it’s similar to a talk on a conference. But with significant differences:
  more broaden audience and it lasts the whole week!
* you will meet new active and interesting people
* it’s significant experience
* it’s fun at least

#### Proposal

[Email][proposal] me if you decided to become an author or want to propose

## My responsibilities as a host

I promise, that I will pick up new authors carefully, but nobody can say
how it will going in real life with every author. Shit happens, you know.

## PS.

I hope this account will help frontend developers to know each other and
links together different geo-, framework-, language-based communities.
