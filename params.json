It’s an ability to read and discuss significant\r\nor controversial issues with weekly changing authors.\r\n\r\n## Why should I care? Why should I follow you?\r\n\r\n— You shouldn’t. Otherwise, you will get a huge amount of pros:\r\n\r\n* Critical thinking: every author is unique, that’s why the views you\r\n  will find can be quintessentially different\r\n* Comfort zone: ispeakweb will make you step out of your comfort zone\r\n  in some cases\r\n* New: you will discover new trends, things and people\r\n* \"Shuffle mode\": it’s like a random song on the radio, you can definitely\r\n  find something, which you most likely would never have found\r\n* Experience: authors can share their experience gained over the years\r\n* Mind shift: authors can show professional insights and new approaches\r\n  that dramatically differ from yours\r\n* You can easily contact the author, ’cause it is two way communication channel\r\n* It’s fun\r\n\r\nFeel free to follow [@ispeakweb][isw] on twitter.\r\n\r\n## How it works?\r\n\r\n— New interesting authors weekly, you read and interact with them.\r\n\r\nI promise, that I will choose new authors carefully, but nobody can say for sure\r\nhow it will be going in real life with every author. Things do happen, you know.\r\n\r\n## Show me more!\r\n\r\n— _ispeakweb_ will have a statistics page and summary pages for each author.\r\n\r\n## What will I get as an author?\r\n\r\n* New followers from your target audience\r\n* Test your ideas: get response from numerous followers\r\n* Test your experience, get advice from somebody more experienced than you\r\n* New people and catchy ideas\r\n* Exciting and completely new experience\r\n* Fewer restrictions as it’s not your private twitter!\r\n* Receive technical and common questions which you would never receive\r\n  in your private twitter.\r\n* It's just an honor\r\n* And fun\r\n\r\n###  What should I know before starting my week?\r\n\r\n#### Are there any general recommendations?\r\n\r\n— Yeah, here they are:\r\n\r\n1. To begin with, update the bio, avatar, location and background image. Make\r\n   sure that description contains link to your own account\r\n2. Say hello and introduce yourself briefly in a couple of tweets\r\n   at the beginning\r\n3. Specify your plans for the week in one tweet\r\n4. If it’s possible, make all mentioned above in five minutes to be sure that\r\n   your \"intro\" tweets will be grouped in timeline\r\n5. If you want to answer, retweet the question first. Then write answers\r\n   as ordinary tweets. If you want, you can include question’s author\r\n   at the end of you answers\r\n6. Say goodbye and show your appreciation to followers at the end\r\n\r\n#### Should I have a plan for my week?\r\n\r\n— Tl;DR: You should. Experience leads us to conclude that having a plan is better\r\nthan not having it. Basically, you don’t need a plan itself — you need\r\na list of topics you want to discuss. Planning have great positive impact\r\non followers and authors itself.\r\n\r\n#### Will I be annoyed by replying? Isn’t it waste of time?\r\n\r\n— In some cases, but communication is the most important and interesting part\r\nof @ispeakweb’s idea. Also, replying is easier than writing original tweets.\r\nAnd you don’t need to feed the trolls.\r\n\r\n#### Are there any popular topics I can discuss with my followers?\r\n\r\n— You probably can discuss something from the list:\r\n\r\n* Ways to rate other developers (github, stackoverflow etc.)\r\n* Rating and reviewing sites\r\n* Making interviews\r\n* Your attitude to opensource\r\n* Developers, you are inspired of or valuable for you (co-workers,\r\n  great mentors or bloggers)\r\n* Your projects\r\n* Forecast frontend trends in 5 years.\r\n* Your workplace and/or health-related topics\r\n* Your work setup: equipment, programs, .dotfiles and other\r\n* Your most interesting technical challenges\r\n* Your start in Computer Science\r\n* Your career path and current position\r\n* Your professional and common plans for future\r\n* Favorite core value and the way you live it\r\n* Your favorite professional experience\r\n* Work-life balance\r\n* Higher education, self-education and online education\r\n* Your contribution and responsibility as a web developer in the overall\r\n  picture of the world\r\n\r\n#### How to make a proposal?\r\n\r\n— [Email me][proposal] if you’re willing to lead [@ispeakweb][isw] for one week\r\nor want to suggest somebody else.\r\n\r\n## Code of Conduct\r\n\r\nPlease, be polite and have respect to your followers.
